# Car Racing Game built with C and graphics.h
This is a legacy code written by me in old ages. I keep it here because it's a memory for me and I don't want to lose it. I have no idea why I did it in that way. So please don't ask anything, I don't know anything :)

# Features
1. It has no feature :)
2. It is bad code
3. It is really bad code and can harm your eyes and brain
4. Even if it's a racing game, you are all alone. Not racing with anyone.
5. The white rectangle in middle is there to pretend like a car :D
